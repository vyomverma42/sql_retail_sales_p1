# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Database**: `p1_retail_db`

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. This project is ideal for those who are starting their journey in data analysis and want to build a solid foundation in SQL.

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `p1_retail_db`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

CREATE TABLE retailsales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,	
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,	
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,	
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retailsales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retailsales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retailsales;

SELECT * FROM retailsales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

DELETE FROM retailsales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05**:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM retailsales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';
```

2. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022**:
```sql
 SELECT
*
from retailsales
 where category='clothing'
 and sale_date >= '2022-11-01'
 and sale_date < '2022-12-01'
 and quantiy >=4
```

3. **Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.**:
```sql
Select
category,
sum(total_sale) as netsale,
count(*) 
from retailsales
group by category
```

4. **Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.**:
```sql
select 
  avg(age)
  from retailsales
  where category = 'beauty'
```

5. **Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.**:
```sql
select * from retailsales
where total_sale >1000
```

6. **Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.**:
```sql
select
  category,
  gender,
  count(*) as total_transactions
  from retailsales
  group 
  by 
  category,
  gender
  order by category
```

7. **Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year**:
```sql
select
   YEAR(sale_date) as saleyear,
   MONTH(sale_date)as salemonth,
   avg(total_sale),
   rank() over (partition by YEAR(sale_date) order by  avg(total_sale) desc) as ranked
   from retailsales
   group 
   by
   year(sale_date),
   MONTH(sale_date)
   
SELECT TOP 1 WITH TIES
    YEAR(sale_date) AS SaleYear,
    DATENAME(month, sale_date) AS BestSellingMonth,
    CAST(AVG(total_sale) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS AverageSale,
    CAST(SUM(total_sale) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS TotalSales
FROM retailsales
GROUP BY 
    YEAR(sale_date), 
    MONTH(sale_date), 
    DATENAME(month, sale_date)
ORDER BY 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY YEAR(sale_date) ORDER BY SUM(total_sale) DESC);
```

8. **Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales **:
```sql
select top 5
  customer_id,
  sum(total_sale) as totalsale
  from retailsales
  group by customer_id
  order by sum(total_sale) desc
```

9. **Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.**:
```sql
select
  category,
  count(distinct customer_id)
  from retailsales
  group by category
```

10. **Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)**:
```sql
with hourly_sale
as
(
select *,
   case
       when datepart(hour, sale_time) <12 then 'Morninig'
	   when datepart(hour, sale_time) between 12 and 17  then 'Afternoon'
	   else 'Evening'
	   end as shift
from retailsales
)
select
shift,
count(*) as total_orders
from hourly_sale
group by shift
```

## Findings

- **Customer Demographics**: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing and Beauty.
- **High-Value Transactions**: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
- **Customer Insights**: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.

## Reports

- **Sales Summary**: A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.
- **Trend Analysis**: Insights into sales trends across different months and shifts.
- **Customer Insights**: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to SQL for data analysts, covering database setup, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and business-driven SQL queries. The findings from this project can help drive business decisions by understanding sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.
